# Fraud Transaction Detector
Credit Card Fraud detection using Machine Learning:

Many people use credit cards to buy things online or in stores. But sometimes, fraudsters steal credit card information and use it to buy stuff without permission. These credit card frauds can cause many problems for customers and companies. To stop credit card fraud, we need new ways to discover when someone uses a credit card that is not theirs. One of these new ways is machine learning. Machine learning is when computers learn from data and make predictions. This Project will explain how machine learning can help us detect credit card fraud and make our money safer.

The Rising Wave of Credit Card Fraud - Credit card fraud is a growing threat that affects millions of people globally. As technology continues to advance, fraudsters are also becoming more advance in their methods. From identity theft to skimming devices, criminals constantly develop new techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in the system. To tackle fraud effectively, a proactive and adaptive approach is necessary.

The Role of Machine Learning in Financial Security - Machine learning use smart rules to look at a lot of data, find what is normal and what is not, and catch fraudsters. This way, we can stop fraudsters before they do more harm.

To sum up, machine learning can help us stop credit card fraud. It is a big change in the way we fight against fraudsters who steal money. Machine learning can look at data, find what is normal and what is not, and catch bad people fast. It can also learn from new ways of stealing and stop them. As computers get better, working together with humans and machine learning will make our money safer.

# Approach 1:
1. Helps with the comparison among the different ML Models and their evaluation performance
2. Dataset Link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CUT3uQzV3IgCS15NkgwrhoSJmpLmaJua/view?usp=sharing
3. Process : cdd dataset -> split the data into test and train -> Apply Various Models -> Evaluation Metric -> Taking User Input and predict the fraud or not fraud
4. Model Used : Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors
